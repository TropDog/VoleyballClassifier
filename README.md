## Project: Volleyball Action Classification Based on Video
Master thesis project

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a classifier that, based on volleyball match video, can predict which team scored a point: the team on the left side (`Left`) or the team on the right side (`Right`). This project is particularly useful for sports analytics, where automatic recognition of scoring actions can speed up the match analysis process.
